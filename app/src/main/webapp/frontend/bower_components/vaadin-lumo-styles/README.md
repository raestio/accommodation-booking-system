# Lumo

*Lumo ‚Äì ‚ú® enchantment (Finnish) and üîÜ light (Esperanto)*

**Lumo is a design system foundation** for modern, beautiful and accessible web applications.

Lumo contains foundational styles ‚Äì¬†typography, colors, visual style, sizing & spacing and icons ‚Äì that components and applications can use to achieve a consistent visual design.

The implementation of Lumo is based on CSS custom properties, and [Polymer 2.0 style modules](https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/devguide/style-shadow-dom#style-modules). Note, that you don‚Äôt need to use Polymer to build your application in order to use Lumo, though it is recommended.


## Documentation

*üöß Documentation will eventually be deployed at https://vaadin.com/themes/lumo üöß*

For documentation and instructions how to get started, use the ‚ÄúDocumentation‚Äù link in the latest [release notes](https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-lumo-styles/releases).


## Part of the Vaadin platform

Lumo is maintained as a part of the [Vaadin platform](https://vaadin.com/).

[Vaadin components](https://vaadin.com/components) is a collection of web components that use the Lumo design language as their default theme. The [Vaadin app starters](https://vaadin.com/start) are also based on Lumo.


## Roadmap

Currently, Lumo is perhaps just a glorified visual style guide. The intention, however, is to gradually grow it to contain design guidelines and patterns as well, with a focus on enterprise/business application use cases. The vision is that you could use Lumo as a starting point for creating your own design system.

Also, the technical implementation is expected to evolve together with Vaadin components and Polymer, with Polymer 3 around the corner.
